# Pagination_Dynamic
I created a reusable pagination component in JavaScript and React, designed to work across multiple tables. It leverages react-icons for intuitive navigation. The component is customizable, allowing adjustments for items per page, current page, and total pages. This ensures a consistent UI across the app while reducing redundant code.
